1. Always apply materials to the objects in the scene with a name that fits that specific object.
2. Always reset pivot after you have applied changes to the model.
3. Always give every part of the model a correct name that suits it.
4. Always reset XPos after you have scaled the object, if you have worked in a larger scale previously, be sure to change it to a realistic scale later on.
5. Everytime you export an model, be sure to export the Smoothing groups, turbosmooth (if used) and tri's aswell.
6. Not neccesarily but try to keep the model under 5.000 - 10.000 polygons.
7. Everytime you have finished the model be sure to check for Ngons just to be sure.
8. Try to keep the vertexes in your model straightforward and try not to make a mess of it.
9. Try to use as many quads as possible, this helps when you are trying to select multiple lines at once.
10. Be sure to deliver the model before the deadline arises.
